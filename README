
This clEnvironment API allows you to precompile your OpenCL kernels into
binaries then import them into you C/C++ code as statically defined arrays of
data which can then be re-used with the clCreateEnvironmentFromBins API. The
make system herein also forces the %.cl to %.h conversion to be a dependency
on the successful creation of your program/library/shared object. This means
that if your .cl files do not compile correctly you can not build your target,
thus pushing the run-time OpenCL build stages back into build-time builds. It
also allows you to completely specify a generic OpenCL Kernel call via predefined
structures, thus freeing you to not worry about how to queue/call/pass args/etc.
